# Great reads on various topics (JS, Linux, etc.)

I've recently been reading up various books and articles on several topics such
as JavaScript and the Linux kernel. Here are some noteworthy reads for
future reference.

## JavaScript

 * [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

## Linux kernel
 * [Linux Kernel Development](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/Linux_Kernel_Development.html?id=1nCQJE0oRE0C/)

## Game design (quite interdisciplinary)
