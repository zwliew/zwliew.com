# zwliew.github.io

My personal website (portfolio, blog, and stuff).

## Available hosts:
https://zwliew.netlify.com (preferred)\
https://zwliew.github.io (Does not support page navigation via URL)

## Background
Currently, it's built using vanilla JS with no prebuilt libraries/frameworks.
The main reason for this is I'd like to take this as an opportunity to learn
frontend development from the ground up, starting from the basics that the
web has to offer.

When I decide to move on to a better method of doing something, I'll refactor
the code as necessary. As such, not only will the website improve iteratively,
I too, will learn bit by bit.

## Changelog
27 May 2018: Building the initial website using vanilla JS\
03 Aug 2018: Switched to Netlify hosting to take advantage of pushState redirects
