# zwliew.github.io

My personal website comprising my portfolio and some notes.

## Available hosts:
https://zwliew.netlify.com (preferred)\
https://zwliew.github.io (does not properly support URL page navigation)

## Background
Currently, it's built using vanilla JS with no prebuilt libraries/frameworks.
The main reason for this is I'd like to take this as an opportunity to learn
frontend development from the ground up, starting from the basics that the
web has to offer.

When I decide to move on to a better method of doing something, I'll refactor
the code as necessary. As such, not only will the website improve iteratively,
I too, will learn bit by bit.

## Platform compability
The website currently uses modern features like ES6 modules and Web Components,
which may not be implemented by various platforms as of yet. It is mainly
tested on the latest version of Chrome. Backward compatibility will be
introduced in the future.
